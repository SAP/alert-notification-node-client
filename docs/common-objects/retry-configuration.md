## Description

This object is used to setup a retry configuration for the Alert Notification service client. The logic behind is as simple as follows - if a request to Alert Notification service fails it will be retried until the _maxRetries_ are reached and each retry will be attempted after the given _retryBackoff_.

## Properties

```
