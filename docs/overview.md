## What is SAP Alert Notification service for SAP BTP?

Alert Notification service is part of the DevOps portfolio of the SAP Business Technology Platform. The service is specialized in instant delivery of events coming straight from the core platform services, e.g. database or application monitoring tools. This way you're always the first one notified whenever an issue with your dependency occurs. Additionally, Alert Notification service provides means for posting real-time
crucial events directly from your application. All those events altogether - either your custom events or the platform ones, could be received on whatever channel is preferred - e-mail, Slack, custom webhook, etc.
Furthermore, events can even be stored in Alert Notification service storage and pulled from it later.

## Features

* _Post custom events_
* _Pull already stored events - either custom or platform events, and on the other hand, either stored by request or stored because the requested action has failed for some reason_
* _Manage your actions, conditions and subscriptions_

## Installation

Node package manager will be used in order to install Alert Notification service client:

```bash
$ npm i @sap_oss/alert-notification-client
```

## Usage

In order to use the client you will first have to import it and create an instance:

```js
import { AlertNotificationClient, RegionUtils, BasicAuthentication } from '@sap_oss/alert-notification-client';

const client = new AlertNotificationClient({
  authentication: new BasicAuthentication({
    username: '<your-technical-client-username>', // Replace with your username
    password: '<your-technical-client-password>' // Replace with your password
  }),
  region: RegionUtils.EU10 // Choose your region
});
```
